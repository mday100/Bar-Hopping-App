## WhatsHOT!

## Summary

WhatsHOT! is a work-in-progress eventual mobile app I developed for a final project at [New York Code + Design Academy] (http://nycda.com), a 12-week Ruby on Rails and JavaScript web development intensive in New York City.

Built with Ruby on Rails on the backend and Javascript and Ajax on the frontend.

## Motivation

Know where all the hot spots are nearby with real-time help from people that are there!

WhatsHOT! is a community-based events lister and indicator. Join other people in your area who share real-time event information, saving everyone time and expections. Know before hand if an event is worth going to!

## Notes

The Foursquare API was originally implemented to provide real-time checkin data. Results were mixed and currently a host of other APIs are being tested to provide an events lister during the beginning stages of the product life cycle (until more users can provide this information).

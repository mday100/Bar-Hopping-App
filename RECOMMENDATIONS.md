Matthew, here are some recommendations to help you with this project. Just some best practices and libraries that will speed your development effort:

* [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    * Specifically check out [Bootstrap Forms](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms)
* [Angular UI](http://angular-ui.github.io/) Great directives to go with Bootstrap 3 CSS.
* [AngularJS Google Maps](https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps)
* [Angular Fire Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/firebase/generator-angularfire)


I think you have chosen a fairly ambitious project. Depending on how far along you are with Rails, 
you may want to consider cutting Firebase from your requirements. Also, I would recommend focusing on
only mobile for phase 1. If that goes well, release it for tablets and desktop, later.
Good luck, and don't be shy about reaching out with questions.
